What are the uses of:
- pre-order traversal of binary tree (get prefix expression on an expression tree)
- post-order traversal of binary tree (postfix expression, delete a tree)
- binary search tree, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/?ref=gcse
- binary heap: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-heap/?ref=gcse
- In-order tree traversal without recursion and without stack, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion-and-without-stack/?ref=gcse
